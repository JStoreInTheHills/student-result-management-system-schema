To use this schema, you'll need to have a database management system installed, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. Once you have a database system set up, you can create a new database and import the SQL file provided in this repository.

php
Copy code
$ mysql -u <username> -p <database_name> < schema.sql
Schema Overview
The Student Result Management System schema is composed of several tables, including:

students - Contains information about each student, such as their name, email, and ID.
exams - Contains information about each exam, such as the exam name, date, and duration.
results - Contains the actual exam results for each student and exam.
In addition to these main tables, the schema includes several auxiliary tables for managing relationships and metadata, such as:

departments - Contains information about each department, such as the department name and ID.
courses - Contains information about each course, such as the course name and ID.
enrollments - Contains information about which students are enrolled in which courses.
Usage
To use this schema, you'll need to have a basic understanding of SQL and how to interact with a database management system. Once you have imported the SQL file, you can start querying the database using SQL commands.

Here are some examples of common queries you might use with this schema:

sql
Copy code
-- Get a list of all students
SELECT * FROM students;

-- Get a list of all courses
SELECT * FROM courses;

-- Get a list of all exam results for a particular student
SELECT * FROM results WHERE student_id = 1234;
